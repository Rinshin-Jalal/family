### **PAGE 1: THE "HUB" (Home Feed)**
**The goal:** Trigger **Curiosity** and **FOMO** (Fear Of Missing Out).

#### **Where at where?**
The very first screen after logging in.

#### **What at what?**
*   **The Teen (16-22):**
    *   **View:** An **Infinite Vertical Scroll** (TikTok style). Full-screen AI visuals.
    *   **Content:** "Grandpa’s Summer of '68" – a cool, abstract neon image of a car.
    *   **Action:** Swipe up. The story plays automatically (Audio).
    *   **Hack:** The visual is so cool they *want* to screenshot it. The UI is minimal so they focus on the story.

*   **The Parent (25-45):**
    *   **View:** A **"Masonry Grid"** (Pinterest style). Organized, manageable.
    *   **Content:** Shows the *Progress* of the family. "3 Stories captured this week."
    *   **Action:** Tap a card to open details.
    *   **Hack:** Gives the parent a sense of **"Legacy Control."** They see the archive growing, which validates their subscription payment.

*   **The Child (3-12):**
    *   **View:** **"The Storybook Mode."** One huge card in the center. No scrolling list.
    *   **Content:** "Grandpa’s Car." A giant button: **"Listen"**.
    *   **Action:** Taps "Listen." The story plays.
    *   **Hack:** Removes the "Paradox of Choice." They don't have to find anything. The app says, "Here is the story. Enjoy."

*   **The Elder (70+):**
    *   **View:** (On Phone) They land on the **"Voice Home."** An AI voice greets them: *"Hello [Name], would you like to hear the story your grandson told yesterday, or shall I ask you a new question?"*
    *   **Hack:** **Cognitive Load Reduction.** No screen to look at. Just a friendly voice guiding them.

### **PAGE 2: THE "STUDIO" (Creation Page)**
**The goal:** Lower the **Friction** of recording.

#### **Where at where?**
Triggered by tapping a "Floating Action Button" (Plus/Mic) or receiving a Prompt.

#### **What at what?**
*   **The Teen (16-22):**
    *   **View:** Minimalist. Just the **Prompt Text** and a **Record Button**.
    *   **Content:** Prompt: *"What is your unpopular opinion?"*
    *   **Action:** Hold-to-record. Visualizer shows the waveform. Release to send.
    *   **Hack:** **Social Validation.** It feels like leaving a "Voice Note" in a group chat (familiar behavior), not "doing an interview."

*   **The Parent (25-45):**
    *   **View:** **"Prompt Manager."** They see the AI prompt, but can **Edit it** or **Write a new one**.
    *   **Content:** Text box + Record Button.
    *   **Action:** "Customize Prompt" -> "Record."
    *   **Hack:** **Ownership.** Parents feel smarter if they can ask the *right* question. They aren't just passive users; they are the "Director."

*   **The Child (3-12):**
    *   **View:** **"The Magic Mic."** The app *speaks* the prompt to them first.
    *   **Content:** Prompt: *"What is your favorite toy?"* (Spoken aloud).
    *   **Action:** A Giant Mic Button turns Red. They press it.
    *   **Hack:** **Audio-First.** Removes reading barriers. It becomes a game of "talk to the robot."

*   **The Elder (70+):**
    *   **View:** **(The Phone Call).**
    *   **Content:** AI asks: *"Tell me about the first time you drove a car."*
    *   **Action:** They just talk. They hang up when done.
    *   **Hack:** **Familiarity.** It’s the only interface they have used for 50+ years.

### **PAGE 3: THE "PROFILE" (Motivation Loop)**
**The goal:** Trigger **Dopamine** and **Habit Formation**.

#### **Where at where?**
Accessed via their Avatar/Icon in the top right.

#### **What at what?**
*   **The Teen (16-22):**
    *   **View:** **"My Aesthetic."** A gallery of *only* the stories *they* contributed to.
    *   **Content:** "You have 5 Stories in the archive."
    *   **Action:** Share button (Export to Insta Story).
    *   **Hack:** **Personal Branding.** Teens use it to show their friends/followers how "deep" or "cool" their family history is.

*   **The Parent (25-45):**
    *   **View:** **"Family Stats."**
    *   **Content:** "Streak: 4 Weeks. Total Memories: 42. Next Milestone: 50 Stories."
    *   **Action:** "Upgrade Plan" or "Invite Auntie."
    *   **Hack:** **Completionism.** Parents are obsessed with "filling the book." The progress bar motivates them to nag grandma one more time.

*   **The Child (3-12):**
    *   **View:** **"The Sticker Book."**
    *   **Content:** A blank canvas. Every time they record a story, they get a digital Sticker (e.g., a Star, a Rocket, a Dog).
    *   **Action:** Drag stickers onto a screen.
    *   **Hack:** **Gamification.** They want to collect them all. "I need to record one more to get the Lion sticker."

*   **The Elder (70+):**
    *   **View:** **N/A.** They don't log in. Their reward is the *Phone Call* itself. The interaction *is* the reward (feeling heard).
