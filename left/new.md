STORYRD: VIRAL FEATURES BEYOND AUDIO
The Problem with Audio
Audio is:
├── Hard to share (needs listening time)
├── Not visually appealing
├── Doesn't create FOMO
└── Private by nature
We need:
├── VISUAL (scroll-stopping)
├── QUICK (understand in 3 seconds)
├── SHAREABLE (one tap)
├── INTERACTIVE (creates conversation)
└── FOMO-INDUCING (makes others want it)

│    🖼️  "THE WEDDING DAY"               │
