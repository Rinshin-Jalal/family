The Three Pillars
| Pillar | What It Means | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| CONNECT | Family members interact | Kid reacts to grandma's story, dad adds context |
| PRESERVE | Stories survive the teller | 50 years from now, great-grandkids hear grandma's voice |
| ENGAGE | Not a chore, a joy | Daily family storytime, challenges, reactions |

PRINCIPLE 1: THE RECURRING BEHAVIOR
The Daily Family Behavior
Every day, family members ask:
"What's new in the family story?"
    ↓
They open StoryRd to:
1. See what family members shared
2. Listen to new stories
3. Add their perspective
4. Connect with relatives
The Specific Behaviors
| Behavior | Who | When | Why |
|----------|-----|------|-----|
| Morning Check | Parents | 8 AM | "What did kids/elders record?" |
| Story Time | Kids | Evening | "Hear grandma's story" |
| Weekly Challenge | Family | Sunday | "Everyone record your morning" |
| Reaction | Anyone | Anytime | "Add your perspective" |
| Legacy Contribution | Elders | Weekly | "Share my story for family" |
---
PRINCIPLE 2: THE DAILY QUESTION
The Question for Each Persona
| Persona | The Question |
|---------|--------------|
| Parent (35-50) | "What did my kids and parents record today?" |
| Kid (8-15) | "What story did grandma/grandpa share?" |
| Elder (70+) | "Who listened to my story this week?" |
| Teen (16-22) | "What embarrassing family story is new?" |
The Unified Question
" What's happening in our family today?"

          but her voice is still on this app
